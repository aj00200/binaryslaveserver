Binary Slave
============

Install
-------
We are glad you are interested! However, this software is not yet ready for use in the wild. But if you are looking for adventure, you should just be able to clone the repository, copy main.ini.demo to ~/.binaryslaveserver/main.ini, and run src/binaryslave.py. If not, poke Aj00200 because he forgot to update the readme (or the world exploded and it is his fault).

What is this?
-------------
There is a definite lack of good hacking games on the internet. Games like Uplink and Slave Hack come to mind. These games are fun, but to someone who has an in-depth understanding of how computers work, the games represent an over-simplification of computer intrusion and cyber-crime. Additionally, the games fail to capture many of the real-world implications which exist given that power-grids, factories, water treatment stations, and more are connected to the internet with insecure configurations.

This game attempts to capture more complexities of hacking than is currently available. We are working towards the inclusion of numerous real-world hacking situations which extend beyond the simple point-and-click hacking interfaces provided by other games.

### How do you keep it interesting?
The hard part with any hacking game is that it is difficult to force bugs into the system which can be exploited by later users. We attempt to remedy the situation by requring all traffic in the game to be tunneled though a proxy to enter the game world. This allows us to control the vulnerability of the systems in the game while allowing the user's physical computer to remain untouched.

### What is the story behind the game?
You can find the story in backstory.txt. This story might be updated as development continues or forks of this game might use a different story.

### How do I play?
It pains us to tell you that this game is not ready yet, as awesome as it is. We are really sorry about that and we wake up every morning feeling guility for witholding such an awesome game from the internet. After all, we want to play this game too!

### How can I help?
This can vary widely from moment to moment. If you have lots of experience with Python 3 and you have read [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), you can contact Aj00200 to see if there is anything to help with. Or, you can just do something awesome with the code in your own branch.
