[ The Backstory ]

The rise of the internet was the most prominent technological advance
of the 21st century. However, like any technology, the digital world was
not perfect. At first, security was lax, easily defeated by children who
seemed to naturally grasp the system's faults and limitations in ways
adults could not understand. As more vital infrastructure moved online,
investments in security increased. Still, it was not enough. Entire
corporate networks crumpled under the hands of skilled attackers.

Even as this was happening, thousands of new devices were becoming
attached to the network on a daily basis. Power grids, water treatment
plants, and more. Control over the digital realm was no longer limited
to flipping a few bits, it meant control over the physical space as well.

A battle soon began which had no singular front or border. This battle
was the beginning of the Cyberwar.

However, the internet was a place not easily abandoned, even for the
sake of stability. The world continued to spin as the attacks increased
in frequency and sophistication.

[ Present ]

After a devastating attack obliterated the business you once worked for,
you find yourself without a job. However, shortly after your dismissal,
you received an email offering you the job you have always dreamed of -
computer security.

You reply to the email and they send back credentials for the custom VPN
and hacking interface which exists on their servers. You are now a slave
in this war, fighting in the internet. What you do is up to you. You
can fight for the internet or destroy the free world as we know it. Your
story has yet to be told...
